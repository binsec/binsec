The latest public revision of `binsec` is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/binsec/binsec.

#### Dependencies

[*opam*](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).  
```bash
$ opam install dune menhir ocamlgraph zarith toml
$ opam install bitwuzla # optional -- for native SMT solver binding
$ opam install unisim_archisec # optional -- for x86-64, ARMv7 and ARMv8
$ opam install curses # optional -- for real time summary window
```

## Build instructions

#### With `make`

[Makefile](Makefile) is a wrapper around `dune` build system.  
When `opam` is available, using the command `make` will automatically install the missing dependencies.

---
:information_source: **Local opam switch**  
If `opam` is available, using the following command will create a new OCaml switch inside the BINSEC tree.
```bash
OCAML_COMPILER=4.09.1 make switch
```
A local switch makes the installation of dependencies, including ocaml supported version, not impacting the system wide ocaml configuration.  
*Doing so, everything installed will be readily available but only inside the BINSEC directory.*

---

Run the following in order to build the `binsec` executable:
```bash
make
```
Then run the following in order to install `binsec` in the current switch:
```bash
make install
```

#### With `dune`

Make sure the above dependencies are available.

Run the following in order to build `binsec` executable:
```bash
dune build @install
```

`binsec` executable can be found in
`_build/install/default/bin`.

Run the following in order to install `binsec` in the current switch:
```bash
dune install
```
Or use it locally with:
```bash
dune exec -- binsec [...]
```
